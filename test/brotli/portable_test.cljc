   Real compressed streams still come from the reference encoder — a decoder can
   only be checked against data somebody else produced — but here they are
   *recorded* in `brotli.fixtures` rather than generated, so the same decode paths
   are exercised on a runtime with no shell. The broad sweep across every quality
   and window size is in `brotli.oracle-test`."
