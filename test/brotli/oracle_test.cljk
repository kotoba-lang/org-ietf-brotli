(ns brotli.oracle-test
  "Conformance against the reference brotli, via the `brotli` CLI.

   One direction only, because there is no encoder here — which is fine, since
   for a decoder that is the direction that matters. The sweep is wide on purpose:
   brotli's quality levels do not merely tune a match finder, they turn *format
   features* on and off. Low qualities emit one block type and no context
   modelling; high ones split blocks across three categories, use several literal
   trees behind a context map, and lean on the static dictionary. A decoder can be
   wrong in any of that while looking healthy elsewhere.

   Skipped loudly when `brotli` or python3 is missing rather than passing
   silently."
